# Inventory MS

## Simple interactive web (frontend) for an Inventory Management System


The backend is mocked for example to retrieve data from a hardcoded pre-defined store. The UI allows users to perform the following operations:  

- Add a new product to the inventory. 
- Update the quantity of a product in the inventory. 
- List all products in the inventory. 
- Search for a product by name and display its details. 
- Remove a product from the inventory.
